            <p>Can education move from merely imparting knowledge to showing how to apply that knowledge? Can we as parents move from mindless test-scores to a more meaningful method of evaluation? Can a child be taught to recognise and create value in everything he does?These were some questions that inspired us to start The Gaudium. Gaudium means ‘Joy’ in Latin. At The Gaudium, we will help each child find joy through the core values of Integrity, Perseverance, Compassion, Appreciation, Humility, Respect and Tolerance.</p>
        <p>We are a CBSE, CI & IB World School in Hyderabad. The Gaudium School is a PYP Authorized IB World School and authorised IB Diploma Programme school. These are schools that share a common philosophy — a commitment to high quality, challenging, international education that The Gaudium School believes is important for our students. Only schools authorized by the IB Organization can offer any of its four academic programmes: the Primary Years Programme (PYP), the Middle Years Programme (MYP), the Diploma Programme or the Career-related Programme (CP). For further information about the IB and its programmes, visit http://www.ibo.org. We will help each child identify and develop his individual tool for real happiness, which he will take beyond the school. The environment that we provide and the facilities that we offer will help a child excel and find joy in everything he does.The Gaudium is promoted by Ms Kirthi Reddy, who belongs to the Promoter Group of Aurobindo Pharma Limited, one of the top 5 Indian Pharma Companies.</p></div>
